WebBlender is a web-based implemented of blender's (the 
open-source 3D content creation suite) architectural
design.  It derives its core types from Blender's SDNA system.

The goal is to have something flexible enough that it can read
and write .blends while preserving information it does not 
understand (currently reading works).
